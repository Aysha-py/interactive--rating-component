Hi, thanks for checking out my repository.

This is an interactive-rating-component card. A project replication from www.frontendmentor.io. 

I replicated this project to practice my javascript skills. This project was completed with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT only.

<u>Features of the project.</u>

1. User can rate a service by clicking on a particular number between 1 - 5.
2. User can submit their rating and they get a feedback text after submission.
3. User must select a rating, else a feedback that request that they select a rating is gotten.
4. User can rate again after submission of the first rating.
5. Active stats for rating number and buttons before submitting.
6. Mobile-responsive.

Below is a Screenshot of the interface.
